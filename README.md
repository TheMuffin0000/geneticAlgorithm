# geneticAlgorithm
this is a basic solution to the travaling sails problem using genetic algorithems 
to run this code you can change the variabuls to get different out puts otherwise just run main.java (this is also where all the variabuls to change the number of generations the population size and the number of citys are)
i plan to add a way to visualize the cityes using javafx
